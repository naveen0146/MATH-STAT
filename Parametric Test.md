 What Is a Parametric Test?
A parametric test is a statistical test that assumes the data follows a known distribution (usually normal distribution) and uses that assumption to make inferences.

🧠 In Simple Words:
Parametric tests work with averages and need the data to be normal (bell-shaped), continuous, and equal in variance (spread).

🎯 When to Use Parametric Tests?
Use them when:

Your data is numeric (like satisfaction score, age, ticket price).

Your data is normally distributed.

The groups you compare have similar spread (variance).

🔢 Common Parametric Test Types (with Travel Analogies)
Test Name	Use Case	Analogy in Travel Domain
t-test (independent)	Compare the mean of two groups	Like comparing average satisfaction between Business and Economy class.
t-test (paired)	Compare two scores from the same passengers (before/after)	Like comparing passenger satisfaction before and after meal service.
ANOVA	Compare means of 3+ groups	Comparing satisfaction in Economy, Economy Plus, and Business.
Pearson Correlation	Check if two numeric variables move together	See if age increases → satisfaction increases.
Linear Regression	Predict one variable using another	Predict satisfaction based on ticket price or age.
Z-test	Like a t-test, but for large samples	Comparing average wait time at two airport gates with a huge dataset.

✈️ Parametric Testing Analogy (Airline Example)
Imagine checking if Business class gives better legroom than Economy.
You measure the average seat space in each.
If the data is normally shaped (no weird outliers), you use a t-test to say:
“Yes! Business class truly has more room — and it's not just random.”

That’s a parametric test in action:
It trusts the average and assumes the data is well-behaved.

📌 Summary (1 Line):
Parametric tests compare averages or numeric relationships when data is normal and clean.
