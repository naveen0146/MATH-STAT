Airline Satisfaction Analysis by Age Group
Objective  
Investigate whether passenger satisfaction and inflight service ratings differ by age group using statistical and Bayesian methods.

Dataset & Preprocessing  

Data Source: `airline_ratings` table from MySQL (Travel database)  

Key Features:  
age  
class  
inflight_wifi_service  
seat_comfort
cleanliness  
food_and_drink  
satisfaction 

Data Cleaning Steps:  
- Dropped duplicates  
- Filled missing numeric values with mean  
- Filled missing categorical values with mode  

Segmentation by Age Group: 
- Young: ≤ 30  
- Middle-aged: 31 – 60  
- Senior: > 60  

Point Estimation  
The mean (average) score for each service feature in every age group.
Use: Provides insight into the central tendency of ratings by group.

Confidence Intervals  

Purpose: Quantify the uncertainty around the mean ratings.

Details:
- 95% Confidence Interval = Mean ± Margin of Error  
- Margin of Error calculated using standard error and t-distribution  

Visualization:
Bar plots with error bars highlight the confidence in service experience ratings across age groups.

Hypothesis Testing (Frequentist: ANOVA)  
Goal: Test if mean ratings differ significantly across age groups.
Method: One-way ANOVA  

Hypotheses:  
- Null (H₀): All groups have the same mean rating.  
- Alternative (H₁): At least one group differs.  

Significance Level (α): 0.05  
Interpretation of p-value:  
- p < 0.05 → Reject H₀ → Significant difference exists  
- p ≥ 0.05 → Fail to reject H₀ → No significant difference  

Visualization: Bar plots of p-values per feature with a red α line (0.05) indicating significance threshold.

Bayesian Inference  
Compute the probability that one age group rates a service lower than another.

Approach:
- Simulate posterior samples of the mean using normal distribution:  
  N(mean, std / √n)  
- Compare samples across groups to estimate probabilities, e.g.,  
  P(Young < Senior in Seat Comfort)  

Interpretation:  
| Probability | Evidence Strength                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| > 0.95      | ✅ Strong evidence first group rates lower |
| > 0.80      | ⚠️ Moderate evidence               |
| ≤ 0.80      | ❌ Weak or no evidence             |

Export  

A CSV summary file `age_group_summary.csv` is generated containing:  
- Satisfaction distribution per age group  
- Mean ratings for all service features  

Tools Used  
- Python Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.stats`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- Database: MySQL  
- Statistical Methods: Mean, Confidence Intervals, ANOVA, Bayesian Posterior Sampling  

Conclusion  
This project combines descriptive statistics, frequentist inference, and Bayesian probability to provide a comprehensive analysis of customer satisfaction differences across age segments. The insights gained can guide airline service improvements and targeted marketing strategies.
